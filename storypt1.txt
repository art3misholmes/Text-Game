Jack: "Ok we're here, now what?"

Kate: " We hop the fence and see what they are hiding in there."

*Kate and Tom climb the barb wire fence.

Jack: "This isn't going to end well."

*Jack sighs and climbs the barb wire fence.

Tom: "There's nothing here except old base housing and some old air hangers!"

Kate: "There has to be something here! Why would it be off limits to the public then?"

Jack: "I don't kno..."

*The ground begins to shake and a sink hole opens beneath the three friends.

Jack: "noooo..."

* The three fall into the sink hole.

Jack: "Where are we?"

Tom: "I don't know."

Kate: "Told you we'd find something!"

*Jack and Tom look at Kate in confusion.

Kate: "What?"

Jack: "How can you be saying "I told you so" at a time like this! We almost died!"

Tom: "Yeah Kate, that's pretty messed up."

*Kate shrugs.

Jack: "Anyway, how are we getting out of here?"

Kate: "I bet one of these caves leads out."

*Jack looks up at the gaping hole they just fell in and the errie caves.

Jack: "Ok spooky caves, let's go."

Kate: "So which cave leads out?"
