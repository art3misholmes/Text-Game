*The three friends aproch an old, rusty hatch leading up.

Tom: "This must be our way out!"

Jack: "Or this leads to some where way worse."

*Kate climbs the lader leading to the hatch and trys to open it.

Kate: "Will you to quite jabering and come help me!"

*All three put all their strength into opening the hatch. It opens slowly. On the other side of the hatch is a room full of old, broken  scientific equpment and fruniture coverd in plastic tarps.

Tom: "What happened here?"

Kate: "I don't know, but this place doesn't give me good vibes."

Jack: "Where even are we? This doesn't look like any area we found before."

Tom: "Maybe we're in on of the hangers, we realy didn't investigate them too much."

Kate: "Maybe."

*Kate walks over to a circular object lying on the ground and picks it up. 

Kate: "Hey guys what's this?"

Jack: "It looks like a tape for an old tape recorder. Wonder what's on it."

Tom: "You think we could play it on this?"

*Tom points to a tape recorder.

Jack: "Yeah. Let's see if this works."

Kate: "Maybe this will tell us where we are or why this place is off limits?"

*Jack puts the tape in and presses play. An man's voice begins to speak as the tape plays.
